# ehemm

A simple Wordpress theme I did some time ago and never really used. I intend to polish it now (my coding got much better since I did this and I think it can be really improved) and use it on a personal blog that I'll be opening *soon*.

## License
If you like it you can use it freely. Period.

## Misc
I'll do a better readme and “licence”, but for now I think this works well.

Cheers.
